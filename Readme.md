====

An application to display various kinds of charts on a house dashboard.

![Temporal Heat-Map Chart](./docs/temporalheatmap.png)

This application can be used to display room temperature, humidity and air quality; water and heating meters readings; weather forecast; and any other kind of data available.

It is designed to run on a [Raspberry Pi 0 W] equipped with a TFT 320Ã—240 display and running [Raspbian Buster], but it should be possible to run it on most platforms.
The dashboard is implemented in [Rust] and it fetches data from an [InfluxDB]
database, which are displayed using [Plotters], a Rust crate for creating charts.

Installation
----

Executables for Linux can be found in the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/claudiomattera/house-dashboard/-/releases).


### From source

This application can be compiled using the Rust toolchain.

~~~~shell
cargo build --release --all-features
~~~~

The resulting executable will be created in `target/release/house-dashboard`.


Usage
----

This is a command-line application that saves charts as BMP images.

The charts are defined in a configuration file which is passed to the application through a command-line argument.

~~~~plain
house-dashboard -v \
    --configuration-directory /path/to/configuration/ \
    --output-directory /path/to/generated/charts
~~~~

The `--help` argument describes the command-line interface in details.

~~~~plain
> house-dashboard --help
Create dashboard images

Usage: -v... -c PATH [-o PATH]

Available options:
    -v, --verbose                         Verbosity level
    -c, --configuration-directory <PATH>  Path to configuration directory
    -o, --output-directory <PATH>         Path to output directory (default: .)
    -h, --help                            Prints help information
~~~~


### Configuration

The configuration directory must contain the following [TOML] files:

- `influxdb.toml`: configures the address and credentials of the InfluxDB server.
- `style.toml`: configures the appearance of generated charts.
- `*.toml`: each of those files configures an individual chart.

[TOML]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml


#### InfluxDB Configuration

File `influxdb.toml` must contain the following information:

~~~~toml
url = "https://influxdb.example.com:8086"
# cacert = "/path/to/custom/certification/authority/root.crt"
# dangerously_accept_invalid_certs = false
username = "some-user-name"
password = "some-password"
~~~~


#### Style Configuration

File `style.toml` must contain the following information:

~~~~toml
font_name = "FontName"
font_path = "FontName.ttf" # Relative to the configuration directory
font_scale = 1
system_palette = "Light"
series_palette = "ColorbrewerSet1"
resolution = [320, 240]
~~~~

Recommendation: font [Print Char 21] works quite well for small displays.

#### Chart Configuration

Each of the other `.toml` files defines a specific chart.

Charts can be of several types:

* Infrastructure: Show the status and load of physical servers (measurement `system` in database `telegraf`, limited to hosts with tag `always-on` equal to `true`).
* Proxmox: Show the status and load of virtual machines and containers (measurement `proxmox` in database `telegraf`, limited to hosts with tag `node-fqdn` equal to the value specified).
* Trend: Show a line chart.
* Geographical heat-map: Show a geographical heat-map on regions defined in the configuration file.
* Temporal heat-map: Show a temporal heat-map of a measurement over time.
