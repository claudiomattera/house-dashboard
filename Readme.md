This application can be used to display room temperature, humidity and air quality; water and heating meters readings; weather forecast; infrastructure summary; and any other kind of data available.

It is designed to run on a [Raspberry Pi 0 W] equipped with a TFT 320Ã—240 display and running [Raspbian Buster], but it should be possible to run it on most platforms.
The dashboard is implemented in [Rust] and it fetches data from an [InfluxDB]
database, which are displayed using [Plotters], a Rust crate for creating charts.

Installation
----

This application can be compiled using the Rust toolchain.

~~~~shell
# Install dependencies if building on x86_64
apt-get install --yes libseccomp-dev

# Create the binary in `target/release/house-dashboard`
just build-release

# Create a Debian package in `target/debian/house-dashboard_1.0.0_amd64.deb`
just deb
~~~~


Usage
----

This is a command-line application that saves charts as BMP images.

Watch a [screen cast of running the application](./docs/run.cast).

The charts are defined in a configuration directory which is passed to the application through a command-line argument.

~~~~plain
house-dashboard -v \
    --configuration-directory /path/to/configuration/ \
    --output-directory /path/to/generated/charts
~~~~

The `--help` argument describes the command-line interface in details.

~~~~plain
> house-dashboard --help
Create dashboard images

Usage: -v... -c PATH [-o PATH]

Available options:
    -v, --verbose                         Verbosity level
    -c, --configuration-directory <PATH>  Path to configuration directory
    -o, --output-directory <PATH>         Path to output directory (default: .)
    -h, --help                            Prints help information
~~~~


### Configuration

The configuration directory must contain the following [TOML] files:

- `influxdb.toml`: configures the address and credentials of the InfluxDB server.
- `style.toml`: configures the appearance of generated charts.
- `*.toml`: each of those files configures an individual chart.

[TOML]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml


#### InfluxDB Configuration

File `influxdb.toml` is used to specify the connection to the InfluxDB server, and must contain the following information:

~~~~toml
url = "https://influxdb.example.com:8086"
# cacert = "/path/to/custom/certification/authority/root.crt"
# dangerously_accept_invalid_certs = false
username = "some-user-name"
password = "some-password"
~~~~

Parameters `url`, `username` and `password` should be self-explanatory.
Parameter `cacert` can be optionally used to specify a custom certification authority.
Parameter `dangerously_accept_invalid_certs` can be used to disable TLS validation.


#### Style Configuration

File `style.toml` is used to specify charts style, and must contain the following information:

~~~~toml
font_name = "FontName"
font_path = "FontName.ttf" # Relative to the configuration directory
font_scale = 1
system_palette = "Light"
series_palette = "ColorbrewerSet1"
resolution = [320, 240]
~~~~

A custom font and font file must be specified, and the font name must correspond to the font file.
There are two system palettes: `Light` and `Dark`, and three series palettes: `ColorbrewerSet1`, `ColorbrewerSet2` and `ColorbrewerSet3`.

Recommendation: font [Print Char 21] works quite well for small displays.

#### Chart Configuration

Each of the other `.toml` files defines a specific chart.

Charts can be of several types:

* Infrastructure: Show the status and load of physical servers (measurement `system` in database `telegraf`, limited to hosts with tag `always-on` equal to `true`).
* Proxmox: Show the status and load of virtual machines and containers (measurement `proxmox` in database `telegraf`, limited to hosts with tag `node-fqdn` equal to the value specified).
* Trend: Show a line chart.
* Geographical heat-map: Show a geographical heat-map on regions defined in the configuration file.
* Temporal heat-map: Show a temporal heat-map of a measurement over time.


##### Infrastructure Chart

### Retry on Errors

All charts in the configuration are generated simultaneously.
If generation for any of them fails, it will be retried four times with exponential backoff, for a total of about one minute.
This allows to survive short network issues without delaying execution for too long.
