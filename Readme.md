![Temperature Chart](./docs/temperature.png)

This application can be used to display room temperature, humidity and air quality; water and heating meters readings; weather forecast; and any other kinds of data available.

It is designed to run on a [Raspberry Pi 0 W] equipped with a TFT 320Ã—240 display and running [Raspbian Buster], but it should possible to run it on most platforms.
The dashboard is implemented in [Rust] and it fetches data from an [InfluxDB]
database, which are displayed using [Plotters], a Rust crate for creating charts.

Installation
----

Executables for Linux can be found in the [releases page](https://gitlab.com/claudiomattera/house-dashboard/-/releases).


### From source

This application can be compiled using the Rust toolchain.

~~~~shell
cargo build --release
~~~~

The resulting executable will be created in `target/release/house-dashboard`.


Usage
----

This is a command-line application.
Charts can be either saved as BMP file or displayed directly on the framebuffer, depending on which subcommand is used.
The charts are defined in a configuration file, which is passed to the application through a command-line argument.

~~~~plain
house-dashboard -v --c /path/to/conf.toml save --path /path/to/generated/charts
~~~~

The `--help` argument describes the command-line interface in details.

### Configuration

A [TOML] configuration file is used to define what charts to generate, how to fetch data, and other generic options.

~~~~toml
# Options related to all charts style
[style]
# Font name (must be available as system font)
font = "Apple ]["

# Colour palette for charts (Dark/Light)
palette = "Dark"

# Resolution of generated images (should be the same as the screen)
resolution = [320, 240]


# Options related to the InfluxDB server
[influxdb]
# URL of the InfluxDB server
url = "https://influxdb_hostname:8086"

# Optional path to certificate (necessary if using HTTPS with a self-signed certificate)
cacert = "/path/to/certificate.pem"

# Database name
database = "longterm"

# Username
username = "dashboard"

# Password
password = "[REDACTED]"


# Multiple [[charts]] sections, each generates a chart

[[charts]]
# Chart type (so far only Trend is supported)
kind = "Trend"

# Optional chart title
title = "TEMPERATURE"

# Optional chart Y label
ylabel = "Temperature [C]"

# InfluxDB query to fetch data related for this chart
query = """
SELECT mean(\"temperature\") AS \"mean_value\" FROM \"indoor_environment\"
WHERE time > now() - 1d GROUP BY time(30m),room FILL(none)"""

# Tag used in the GROUP BY $TAG clause
tag = "room"

# Optional X label format
xlabel_format = "%H:%M"


[[charts]]
kind = "Trend"
title = "HUMIDITY"
ylabel = "Humidity [%]"
query = """
SELECT mean(\"humidity\") AS \"mean_value\" FROM \"indoor_environment\"
WHERE time > now() - 1d GROUP BY time(30m),room FILL(none)"""
tag = "room"
